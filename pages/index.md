# History of Women in 20th Century Labor Politics

Throughout the 20th century women worked in various labor reform movements to protect the health and safety of the workforce. Their role in shaping government policy was dependent on successful campaigns and leadership skills.  As the century progressed, some women became directly involved in labor politics working for the United States government. Every achievement that promoted the welfare of the workforce can be attributed to women's input on this subject. Feminist values promoting equal opportunity to education and quality of life were essential to the success of the 20th century.
